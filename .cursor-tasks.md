    * `npx create-next-app@latest ai-recipe-app --typescript --eslint --tailwind --src-dir --app --import-alias "@/*"`
* [x] **Task:** Initialize a Git repository in the project root.
* [x] **Task:** Create a `.gitignore` file with appropriate entries for Next.js, Node.js, and OS-specific files. (Next.js default is good, verify).
* [x] **Task:** Install core project dependencies:
    * [x] `npm install openai` (for OpenAI API interaction)
    * [x] `npm install zustand` (for global state management, if chosen over Context)
    * [x] `npm install lucide-react` (for icons, or another preferred icon library)
    * [x] `npm install uuid` (for generating unique IDs if needed for local storage items)
    * [x] `npm install -D @types/uuid`
* [x] **Task:** Configure Tailwind CSS:
    * [x] Verify `tailwind.config.ts` and `postcss.config.js` are correctly set up by `create-next-app`.
    * [x] Ensure Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`) are in `src/app/globals.css`.
* [ ] **Task:** Set up environment variable handling:
    * [ ] Create a `.env.local.example` file listing required environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`). **(BLOCKED BY TOOL - REQUIRES HUMAN INTERVENTION)**
    * [ ] Create `.env.local` and add it to `.gitignore`. **(BLOCKED BY TOOL - REQUIRES HUMAN INTERVENTION FOR FILE CREATION; .gitignore part is done for `.env.local.example`)**
    * [ ] Load environment variables in Next.js config if needed for server-side access, or directly via `process.env` for API routes/server components.
* [x] **Task:** Define basic project structure within `src/`:
    * `src/app/` (for routes - Next.js App Router)
    * `src/components/` (for reusable UI components)
        * `src/components/ui/` (for generic UI elements like buttons, inputs - if not using a pre-built library like Shadcn/UI)
    * `src/lib/` (for helper functions, AI API clients, etc.)
    * `src/hooks/` (for custom React hooks)
    * `src/store/` (for Zustand state management, if used)
    * `src/types/` (for TypeScript type definitions)
* [x] **Task:** Create basic TypeScript type definitions:
    * In `src/types/recipe.ts`: Define `Ingredient`, `RecipeStep`, `Recipe` interfaces.
        * `Ingredient`: `{ id: string; name: string; quantity: string | number; unit: string; notes?: string; }`
        * `RecipeStep`: `{ stepNumber: number; description: string; }`
        * `Recipe`: `{ id: string; title: string; description?: string; ingredients: Ingredient[]; instructions: RecipeStep[]; prepTime?: string; cookTime?: string; servings?: number; cuisine?: string; dietaryTags?: string[]; imageUrl?: string; source: 'ai-generated' | 'user-saved' | 'api-fetched'; notes?: string; createdAt: string; }`
    * In `src/types/userPreferences.ts`: Define `UserPreferences` interface.
        * `UserPreferences`: `{ dietaryRestrictions: string[]; preferredCuisines: string[]; intolerances: string[]; defaultServings: number; }`
* [x] **Task:** Configure ESLint and Prettier for code consistency.
    * [x] Review and customize `.eslintrc.json` if needed. (Reviewed `eslint.config.mjs`)
    * [x] Add Prettier configuration (`.prettierrc.json`) and `eslint-config-prettier`.
    * [x] Add npm scripts for linting and formatting (e.g., `"lint": "next lint"`, `"format": "prettier --write ."`) to `package.json`.
* [x] **Task:** Create initial README.md file with placeholder sections. **(HUMAN REVIEW RECOMMENDED)** For initial app name and short description to ensure they align with overall vision.

## Phase 1: Core UI - Home/Ingredient Input Page (Page 1)

    * [ ] Make a `POST` request to the `/api/generate-recipe` endpoint.
    * [ ] Handle the response:
        * On success: Store the raw AI response and navigate to the Results page (or display results on the same page).
        * On error: Display an error message to the user.
    * [ ] Clear loading state.
* [ ] **Task:** Create a utility function (`src/lib/recipeParser.ts`) to parse the AI's raw text response into the `Recipe` TypeScript object. **(HUMAN REVIEW RECOMMENDED)** Robustness of parsing AI's free-form (or semi-structured) text can be tricky and might need human refinement based on observed AI outputs.
    * [ ] Handle potential inconsistencies in AI output format (robust parsing).
    * [ ] Use regular expressions or string splitting methods.
